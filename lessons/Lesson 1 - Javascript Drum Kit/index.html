            ## Introduction

            In past lesson, we learned some basic programming skill with Kajero,
            but it not good enough because Kajero can not handle
            [HTML DOM](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp).
            JavaScript needs DOM to access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

            Therefore, in this lesson, we will focus on guiding you on:

            - Make your hand dirty to create few HTML elements.
            - Beautify your HTML element with Bootstrap CSS.
            - Manipulate DOM with Javascript.

            In the end of lesson, we will challenge you to build a JavaScript Drum Kit.
            It is not hard to build when you know manipulate DOM with JavaScript.

            ## Using JS Bin

            Since Kajero can not handle DOM, therefore we need help from
            another JavaScript hero - [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output).
            It is a very handy tool, you can test your code in here.
            In addition, this also is the best tool to learning how to code for the web.

            > JS Bin : [https://jsbin.com/](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output)

            ### 1. Do I need to register a JS Bin account?

            We highly recommend you to register an account,
            but it is okay even you don't want to register an account.
            You still can use JS Bin without registration.
            The only limitation is you need to self-tracking all your JS Bin URLs.
