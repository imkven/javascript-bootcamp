            ## Introduction

            In past lesson, we learned some basic programming skill with Kajero,
            but it not good enough because Kajero can not handle
            [HTML DOM](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp).
            JavaScript needs DOM to access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

            Therefore, in this lesson, we will focus on guiding you on:

            - Make your hand dirty to create few HTML elements.
            - Manipulate HTML DOM with Javascript.
            - Using HTML DOM EventListener.

            In the end of lesson, we will challenge you to build a JavaScript Drum Kit.
            It is not hard to build when you know manipulate DOM with JavaScript.

            ## Using JS Bin

            Since Kajero can not handle DOM, therefore we need help from
            another JavaScript hero - [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output).
            It is a very handy tool, you can test your code in here.
            In addition, this also is the best tool to learning how to code for the web.

            > JS Bin : [https://jsbin.com/](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output)

            ### 1. Do I need to register a JS Bin account?

            We highly recommend you to register an account,
            but it is okay even you not want to register an account.
            You still can use JS Bin without registration.
            The only limitation is you need to self-tracking all your JS Bin URLs.

            ## Quiz

            ### Question 1
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.
            Write JavaScript to popup message to user when clicking on "Clap" box.

            Required: Must using DOM EventListener approach.

            // Question 1 answer
            ```

            ### Question 2
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.
            We expect when user press "A" on keyboard will add `playing` class
            to 'key' element.

            Tips: Use querySelector to select "data-key" attribute.

            ### Question 3
            In Question 2, we know key code `65` is belong to "A" button on keyboard.
            What is key code for "S" and "D" buttons?

            Tips: Check with 'testkey' page in references at Question 2.

            ### Question 4
            If you done Question 2 correctly,
            you found out the 'orange' border will never disappear.
            Why?

            ```
            // Question 4 answer
            ```

            ### Question 5
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.
            Remove 'orange' border after transition end.

            Tips: Using `querySelectorAll` to find all key elements.

            ### Question 6
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.
            You need fill in the blank inside `playSound` function.
            We expect when user press on keyboard,
            the sound will come out from speaker,
            and user will know which sound is playing.

            Required:
            1. Query `data-key` with `querySelector` function.
            2. Add `playing` class to key element, like what you did in Question 2.
            3. If no key match to audio, do nothing.
            4. Play out sound.
