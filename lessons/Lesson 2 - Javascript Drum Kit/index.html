            ## Introduction

            In the first lesson, we learned some basic Javascript and we used Kajero for all the examples.
            For today's lesson, we're going to show you how Javascript works within a real web page. This means we need to look at HTML - the "language" of the web.
            This also means we need to use a new tool, JSBin, that can do a few things Kajero can't.

            Therefore, in this lesson, we will focus on teaching you:

            - Basics of JSBin
            - Basics of HTML
            - Getting your hand dirty to create few HTML elements
            - Learning about the way Javascript "sees" HTML in the browser
            - Manipulating HTML with Javascript.
            - Learning about what happens when the user interacts with the page

            In the end of the lesson, we will challenge you to build an interactive music instrument app.
            You'll be surprised at how easy it is!

            ## Using JS Bin

            Since Kajero doesn't really support manipulating HTML very well,  we need help from
            another JavaScript hero - [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output).
            It is a very handy tool, you can test your code in here.
            In addition, this also is one of the best tools for learning how to code for the web.

            > JS Bin: [https://jsbin.com/](https://jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output)

            ### 1. Do I need to register a JS Bin account?

            We highly recommend you to register an account,
            but it is okay even you do not want to register an account.
            You still can use JS Bin without registration.
            The only limitation is you'll need to keep track of all your JS Bin URLs.

            ### 2. HTML column

            Whatever change you do in HTML column,
            you will get a real-time result on output column.

            ![HTML column](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%202%20-%20Javascript%20Drum%20Kit/img/html-tab.png)

            ### 3. JavaScript column

            You can test your JavaScript on this column.

            ![JavaScript column](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%202%20-%20Javascript%20Drum%20Kit/img/javascript-tab.png)

            ### 4. Clone JS Bin

            Mostly all following questions will ask you to clone the code in JS Bin.
            Why? Because if you do change on example JS Bin we provided,
            other people will see what your change in our JS Bin link
            and they will never get real original example we gave.

            ![Clone JS Bin](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%202%20-%20Javascript%20Drum%20Kit/img/clone-code.png)

            ## HTML - the HyperText Markup Language

            The most basic language of the web is called HTML. It is a simple "language" in that it has only a few basic rules.
            HTML files are just plain text, but with "tags" that are used to format the text and break it into the section.
            A tag looks like this `<tag>stuff here</tag>` or `<tag />`. The first type is a matched tag and applies the meaning of the tag to whatever is between.
            For example, the `<P>text here</P>` tag will put "text here" in its own paragraph (p for paragraph).

            The second format is for tags that have to mean on their own. For example `<hr />` will put a horizontal line between paragraphs
            <hr /> like that.

            If you know about 20 tags, you can read almost any web page "code". Some of the basic ones are:
            ```
            <P></P> - Paragraph.
            <H1></H1> - 1st level heading (you can do H1, H2, H3, H4, H5).
            <B></B> - Bold.
            <U></U> - Underline.
            <EM></EM> - Italics.
            <I></I> - Also italics, but often has other purposes, like Icons.
            <IMG /> - Display an image.
            <A>link text</A> - Create a link.
            <BUTTON>button text</BUTTON> - Create a button.
            <LI>item</LI> - List item. It must use together with <UL> or <OL>.
            <UL><LI>item one</LI><LI>item two</LI></UL> - a "bulleted list".
            <OL><LI>item one</LI></OL> - a "numbered list".
            <BR /> Line break.
            <DIV></DIV> A "wrapper" that is used heavily with javascript.
            ```

            The tag, plus the information within the tag, is called an "element".

            The next thing to know is that inside a tag you will often see more than just the name. For example:
            `<IMG src='path_to_image.jpg' alt='Text name of image' />`.
            In the above, "src" means the "source" file of the image, and "alt" is the text you'll see when you hover your mouse over the image, or if it fails to load, or if you're using accessibility tools. "src" and "alt" are called properties, or attributes.

            The most important tag properties that you'll be using when you code Javascript are "id" and "class".

            "id" is a unique identifier - for example `<div id="unique"></div>` can be the only element on the page with id="unique".

            "class" is a non-unique identifier, there can be many elements with the same class. For example, `<div class="button">add me</div>` is often used to indicate that the text inside should be rendered as a button.

            There can be multiple classes per tag. For example, `<div class="button large"></div>` vs `<div class="button small"></div>`.

            Classes and identifiers become very important when working with Javascript because you can use them to find and manipulate individual or groups of elements within a page.

            There's one more special tag called `<style></style>` which lets us use another language called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to change how elements appear on the page. We will explore CSS in the next lesson. For now, the important thing to know is that classes and ids are also used heavily by CSS. It's the combination of CSS and Javascript that makes web pages "interactive".

            ## Quiz

            ### Question 1
            Create a new JSBin page.

            Use `<H1><P><HR><B><U><EM>` tags to make a page that looks like the following:

            ![Question 1 example](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%202%20-%20Javascript%20Drum%20Kit/img/question-1.png)

            Hints: You can learn more tags from here: [http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)

            ```
            // Question 1 answer
            ```

            ### Question 2
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.

            Add the class "sound" to the element that contains the word "clap".
            If you are successful, the box should change when the mouse moves into and out of it.

            Use the "onClick" property to write Javascript that pops up a message to the user when clicking in the "Clap" box.

            // Question 2 answer
            ```

            ### Question 3
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.

            Repeat what you did in Question 2, but now write use document.queryselector() and element.addEventListener() to do the same thing.

            Hint: the following ways of writing Javascript have the same outcome:

            ```
            var ele = document.queryselector(".classname");
            ele.addEventListener("click", prompt("what is your name"));
            ```
            and
            ```
            document.queryselector(".classname").addEventListener("click", prompt("what is your name"));
            ```
            and
            ```
            document.queryselector(".classname").addEventListener("click", function() {
                prompt("what is your name");
            });
            ```

            ```

            ### Question 4
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.

            We expect when user press "A" on the keyboard will add a `playing` class
            to the matched key code (e.g. 'data-key="65"') element.

            Hint: Use querySelector to select "data-key" attribute. Key code for "A" is '65'.

            ```
            // Question 4 answer
            ```

            ### Question 5
            In Question 4, we know key code `65` belongs to "A" button on the keyboard.
            What is key code for "S" and "D" buttons?

            Hint: Check with 'testkey' page in references at Question 2.

            ```
            // Question 5 answer
            ```

            ### Question 6
            If you did Question 5 correctly,
            you found out the 'orange' border will never disappear.
            Why?

            ```
            // Question 6 answer
            ```

            ### Question 7
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.

            Remove 'orange' border after transition end.

            Bonus: Use `querySelectorAll` to find all elements.

            // Question 7 answer
            ```

            ### Question 8
            Clone from JS Bin link at below.

            You need fill in the blank inside `playSound` function.
            We expect when user press on the keyboard,
            the sound will come out from the speaker,
            and the user will know which sound is playing.

            Hints:
            1. Query `data-key` with `querySelector` function.
            2. Show "orange" border when the user clicks on specify button.
            3. If user clicks on the undefined key, you can just ignore it (nothing will happen).
