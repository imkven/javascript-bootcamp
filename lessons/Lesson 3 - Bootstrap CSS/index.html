            ## Introduction

            Do you still remember CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) mentioned in the last lesson?
            We will show you how CSS work together with HTML in this lesson.
            CSS like a designer for HTML.
            It uses to describes the style of an HTML element.
            Take a look at an example below.

            ![HTML vs CSS](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%203%20-%20Bootstrap%20CSS/img/html-vs-css.png)

            In this lesson, you will learn about:

            - Basics of CSS
            - Basics of Sass, a preprocessor for CSS
            - Basics of Responsive Web Design (RWD) and why it so important for the modern web
            - Integrate Bootstrap to your project, a web framework built with bunch of features
            - Integrate widespread Bootstrap components in your page

            In end of the lesson, we will challenge you to integrate Bootstrap to
            interactive music instrument app that you created on Lesson 2.

            ## CSS

            A CSS ruleset consists of a selector and a declaration block.

            ```
            .flat {
              // declaration block
              background-color: orange;
            }
            ```

            Selector is same concept with `querySelector` we learned in last lesson.
            In example, `.flat` is a selector. It declared to select all HTML elements that contain `flat` class.

            The curly brackets are declaration block.
            We declare how the element will look like inside this block.
            Remember every declaration must end with a semicolon.
            In the example, I define background color to orange for every HTML elements contain `flat` class.

            ## Sass

            When a project goes larger, CSS stylesheet will get larger too.
            It brings up complexity and difficult to maintain.
            We need a CSS preprocessor to solve this problem.

            Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is one of most popular CSS preprocessor.
            Sass help to convert your programmable CSS code to pure CSS stylesheet.

            ## Responsive Web Design (RWD)

            RWD is a very simple concept.
            Its focus on makes your web page looking well on all devices,
            like desktop, tablet, and phone.

            In this modern era, surfing web not only happens on your Mac or PC,
            most of the time it happen on your phone - your smaller devices.
            RWD allow you define the "look" of the web page in different devices with CSS.
            For example, you can group up menu when the user on a smaller device.

            Pictures at below showing [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/)
            look like when the user in iPhone 6.
            Bootstrap framework is ***RWD-ready***.

            ![Group up menu 1](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%203%20-%20Bootstrap%20CSS/img/group-menu-1.png)

            ## Bootstrap

            > "Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web." - From Bootstrap itself

            Doesn't make much sense eh? Well, a framework is used to make the developer life easier.
            So, whenever you opt to use a framework, you are expecting it to do some heavy lifting for you.
            In Bootstrap, they got tons of [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/).
            For example, [navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) is very common in web application these days (Facebook has it).
            By using the components provided by Bootstrap, you are saving the time used to build the components from scratch and ultimately speed up the development speed.

            "Wait a minute! if everyone is using the same components from Bootstrap, then every website will look alike.", you said.
            Worry not. You can always tinker with the CSS or JS.
            Updating CSS will change the style of the Bootstrap component.
            And calling JS functions provided for each component, you will have different behaviors for the component.

            ## JQuery

            Another option to speed up the development is using JQuery - a JavaScript library that used to simplify JavaScript programming.

            If you are good in JavaScript programming and framework is not a necessity for your web application development, then JQuery might be your thing.
            JQuery consists of many functions which help you achieve the same thing as you will by using JavaScript.
            Just that by using JQuery, it will be much neater and shorter.
            For example, if you wanna change some background color.

            In JQuery, you will do

            ```
            $("body").css("background", "#888");
            ```

            In JavaScript, you will do

            ```
            Function changeBackground(color) {
              Document.body.style.background = color;
            }

            changeBackground("red");
            ```

            Both of them will do the same thing and the Jquery one is relatively shorter.
            You reduce your code length effectively and speed up your development speed by using JQuery.

            ### Don't dive deep in JQuery

            JQuery born in the age of unconvenience JavaScript.
            But, modern JavaScript works very conveniently and some seem like inspired by JQuery.
            For example, `$("body")` and `document.querySelector("body")`, those functions doing same work.
            The first example need help with JQuery but second is pure JavaScript.

            Today, mostly functions you can implement very easy even without help with JQuery.
            For my opinion, JQuery is not a requirement knowledge for web development anymore.
            We talking JQuery here because Bootstrap still relies on it.
            Bootstrap v4 required JQuery to run JavaScript function,
            I believe Bootstrap developers no plan to replace JQuery in short period.

            ## Quiz

            ### Question 1

            Start your new JS Bin and inject Bootstrap into your HTML page.
            You simply insert the latest Bootstrap with 'Add library' menu.

            Note: For our case, injected `<script>` and `<link>` tags must inside the `<head>` tag.

            ```
            Question 1 answer
            ```

            ### Question 2

            Clone JS Bin from the link below.
            As you can see, 'Column A' and 'Column B' are not in the same row.
            Make some change in the grid system, expected outcome 'Column A'
            and 'Column B' should in the same row.

            Replace `container` to `container-fluid` and see the different.
            After you replaced, paste your JS Bin URL to answer block.

            Note: You may need 'Live Preview' to see the change.
