            ## Introduction

            Do you still remember CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) mentioned in the last lesson?
            We will show you how CSS work together with HTML in this lesson.
            CSS like a designer for HTML.
            It uses to describes the style of an HTML element.
            Take a look at an example below.

            ![HTML vs CSS](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%203%20-%20Bootstrap%20CSS/img/html-vs-css.png)

            In this lesson, you will learning about:

            - Basics of CSS
            - Basics of Sass, a preprocessor for CSS
            - Basics of Responsive Web Design (RWD) and why it so important for the modern web
            - Integrate Bootstrap to your project, a web framework built with bunch of features
            - How Bootstrap help on you to build RWD web page
            - Using JavaScript to handle Bootstrap components

            ## CSS

            A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.

            ```
            .flat {
              // declaration block
              background-color: orange;
            }
            ```

            Selector is same concept with `querySelector` we learned in last lesson.
            In example, `.flat` is a selector. It declared to select all HTML elements that contain `flat` class.

            The curly brackets is declaration block.
            We declare how the element will look like inside this block.
            Remember every declaration must end with a semicolon.
            In example, I define background color to orange for every HTML elements contain `flat` class.

            ## Sass

            When a project goes larger, CSS stylesheet will get larger too.
            It brings up complexity and difficult to maintain.
            We need preprocessor to solve this problem.

            Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is one of most popular CSS preprocessor.
            Sass help to convert your programmable CSS code to pure CSS stylesheet.

            ## Responsive Web Design (RWD)

            RWD is very simple concept.
            Its focus on makes your web page looking well on all devices,
            like desktop, tablet, and phone.

            In this modern era, surfing web not only happens on your Mac or PC,
            most of the time it happen on your phone - your smaller devices.
            RWD allow you define the "look" of the web page in different devices with CSS.
            For example, you can group up menu when the user on a smaller device.
            Pictures at below showing [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/)
            look like when the user in iPhone 6.

            ## Bootstrap

            ```
            Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. - From Bootstrap itself
            ```
            
            Doesn't make much sense eh? Well, a framework is used to make the developer life easier. So, whenever you opt to use a framework, you are expecting it to do some heavylifting for you. In Bootstrap, they got tons of [components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/). For example, [navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) is very common in web application these days (Facebook has it). By using the components provided by Bootstrap, you are saving the time used to build the components from scratch and ultimately speed up the development speed. "Wait a minute! if everyone is using the same components from Bootstrap, then every website will look alike.", you said. Worry not. You can always tinker with the CSS or JS. Updating CSS will change the style of the Bootstrap component. And calling JS functions provided for each components, you will have different behaviors for the component.

            @TODO: I thinking we should only need to focus on Bootstrap JS part, since we are JS bootcamp.
            @TODO: Maybe we can simply walk through grid system, button, table, and form.
            @TODO: Arrrr... JQuery...
