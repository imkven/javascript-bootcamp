            ## Introduction

            Do you still remember CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) mentioned in the last lesson?
            We will show you how CSS work together with HTML in this lesson.
            CSS like a designer for HTML.
            It uses to describes the style of an HTML element.
            Take a look at an example below.

            ![HTML vs CSS](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%203%20-%20Bootstrap%20CSS/img/html-vs-css.png)

            ## CSS

            A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.

            ```
            .flat {
              // declaration block
              background-color: orange;
            }
            ```

            Selector is same concept with `querySelector` we learned in last lesson.
            In example, `.flat` is a selector. It declared to select all HTML elements that contain `flat` class.

            The curly brackets is declaration block.
            We declare how the element will look like inside this block.
            Remember every declaration must end with a semicolon.
            In example, I define background color to orange for every HTML elements contain `flat` class.

            ## Sass

            When a project goes larger, CSS stylesheet will get larger too.
            It brings up complexity and difficult to maintain.
            We need preprocessor to solve this problem.

            Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is one of most popular CSS preprocessor.
            Sass help to convert your programmable CSS code to pure CSS stylesheet.

            ## Responsive Web Design (RWD)

            RWD is very simple concept.
            Its focus on makes your web page looking well on all devices,
            like desktop, tablet, and phone.

            In this modern era, surfing web not only happens on your Mac or PC,
            most of the time it happen on your phone - your smaller devices.
            RWD allow you define the "look" of the web page in different devices with CSS.
            For example, you can group up menu when the user on a smaller device.
            Pictures at below showing [Bootstrap website](http://getbootstrap.com/)
            look like when the user in iPhone 6.

            ## Bootstrap

            > Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. - From Bootstrap itself

            Very well self-definition.

            @TODO: I thinking we should only need to focus on Bootstrap JS part, since we are JS bootcamp.
            @TODO: Maybe we can simply walk through grid system, button, table, and form.
            @TODO: Arrrr... JQuery...

            ## Quiz

            ### Question 1

            Start your new JS Bin and inject Bootstrap into your HTML page.
            You simple insert latest Bootstrap with 'Add library' menu.

            Note: For our case, injected `<script>` and `<link>` tags must inside the `<head>` tag.
