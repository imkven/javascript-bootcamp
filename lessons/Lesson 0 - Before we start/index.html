            **Question 1** : Do some change for string inside code block. When you click 'play' icon, the output must be 'Pen Pineapple Apple Pen'.

            ```javascript; runnable
            // Question 1
            // Replace word "Pencil" to "Pen" at string below
            // and click 'play' icon to see change.

            return 'Pencil Pineapple Apple Pencil';
            ```

            **Question 2** : Multiply 123 by 456, then divide the result by 789. The correct answer is a number between 71 and 72.

            ```javascript; runnable
            // Question 2 answer
            ```

            ***Question 3*** : Repeat what you did in Question 2, but only print the answer with just two decimal places.

            ```javascript; runnable
            // Question 3 answer
            ```

            ***Question 4*** : Now repeat question 3 again,
            but using a different approach. We want to convert the number to a “string”
            (text in computer speak) and chop off the part we don’t want.
