            ## Introduction

            Do you still remembers CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) mentioned in last lesson?
            For this lesson, we will show you how CSS work together with HTML.
            CSS like a designer for HTML.
            It use to describes the style of an HTML element.
            Take a look at example below.

            A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.

            Selector is same concept with `querySelector` we learned in last lesson.
            In example, `.flat` is a selector. It declared to select all HTML elements that contain `flat` class.

            The curly brackets is declaration block.
            We declare how the element will look like inside this block.
            In example, I declared background color to orange for every HTML elements contain `flat` class.
