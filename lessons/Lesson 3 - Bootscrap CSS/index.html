            ## Introduction

            Do you still remembers CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) mentioned in last lesson?
            For this lesson, we will show you how CSS work together with HTML.
            CSS like a designer for HTML.
            It use to describes the style of an HTML element.
            Take a look at example below.

            ![HTML vs CSS](https://github.com/imkven/javascript-bootcamp/raw/master/lessons/Lesson%203%20-%20Bootscrap%20CSS/img/html-vs-css.png)

            A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block.

            Selector is same concept with `querySelector` we learned in last lesson.
            In example, `.flat` is a selector. It declared to select all HTML elements that contain `flat` class.

            The curly brackets is declaration block.
            We declare how the element will look like inside this block.
            In example, I declared background color to orange for every HTML elements contain `flat` class.

            ## Preprocessors: Sass

            When a project goes larger, CSS stylesheet will get larger too.
            It brings up complexity and difficult to maintain.
            We need preprocessor to solve this problem.

            Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) is one of most popular CSS preprocessor.
            Sass help to convert your programmable CSS code to pure CSS stylesheet.
